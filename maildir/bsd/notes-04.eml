Has anyone a copy of the study? I'm particularly interested in what they
say about improving IT manpower.

>ICT sector growing at a healthy rate: Nasscom
>
>The software export sector logged in an annual growth of around 30 per
>cent, an impressive performance by all counts. India's software exports
>accounted for around 20.4 per cent of the country's overall export
>revenues during 2002-03.
>While software services continued to display momentum and grow at a
>healthy 26 per cent, it was the newly emerging, IT-enabled services/BPO
>(Business Processing Outsourcing) segment that truly stole the show during
>the year. This market, earmarked to be a "hot" business opportunity for
>the future, grew at over 60 per cent, becoming in the process the most
>significant driver for the software exports industry. The amazing
>performance logged in by the companies operating in this space, reversed
>many expected trends and global forecasts.
>...
>Revenues from ITES exports skyrocketed from Rs 7,100 crore in 2001-02 to
>Rs 11,700 crore during 2002-03, placing the segment among the sunrise
>markets within the Indian ICT domain. The performance of the ITES/BPO
>industry appears to be in line with the forecasts put forth by
>Nasscom-McKinsey, which claim that this sector will be worth $21-24
>billion by 2008 and will employ over 1.1 million Indians.
>...
>A separate and detailed analysis has been provided on the animation
>industry, which is experiencing significant activity on the Indian side
>and is expected to generate substantial export revenues in the years to
>come. A number of animation studios are already dotting the Indian
>landscape and major organisations in the US are outsourcing animation
>projects to these entities. India's unmatched price/performance, skill-set
>and quality proposition is drawing foreign companies to come for their
>animation work to the country.
>...
>While the Indian ICT export market has continued to display momentum, the
>home market has remained sluggish. Growth in this sector in fact dropped
>from 18 per cent during 2001-02 to 13 per cent in 2002-03. Lowered IT
>spend by corporates during 2002-03 and a reduction in IT buying by
>traditionally strong markets such as finance, insurance and banking, lead
>to this overall slowdown.
